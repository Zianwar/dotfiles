# dotfiles
My personal [dotfiles](https://www.quora.com/What-are-dotfiles) and command line configs.
I mainly use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework with a slight customization and some personal functions/aliases... that I find useful.

Feel free top copy whatever you want.
